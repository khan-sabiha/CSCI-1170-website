### Design Decisions and Assumptions
IN THIS SPACE, INCLUDE THE DECISIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS YOU MADE WHEN DEFINING STYLES TO MAKE THE PAGE APPEAR AS PER THE REFERENCE IMAGE.
* I will style the website step by step for example first the navigation bar then the header then the stick to the page navigation bar so on and so forth.
* I assumed the font to be sans-serif throughout the page.
* The first navigation bar that takes to the direct link is box with dark gray as the background colour and the text aligned at the right and the colour of 
the text is white. The font size as 12 and is bold.
* The font family I assumed to be the standard which is the sans-serif.The font size for most of the elements i randomly guessed it and then checked it with the reference page if it matched then I kept it if not the I adjusted it accordingly. 
* For the colors some were clearly visible from the reference page and others I used color zella google extension to find what color it is.
* Other changes I made as I was making changes to each element and then seeing if it matchs the reference page.
